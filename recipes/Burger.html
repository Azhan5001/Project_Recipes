<h1>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</h1>
<p>
    Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions,
     but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:
</p>
<p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before
     forming the mixture into Â¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go.
     Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.
</p>

    <li>1 Large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
</ul>
